# Real-Time Recommendation System for E-commerce

This project implements a real-time recommendation system for an e-commerce platform using both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. The system recommends products to users based on their latest browsing and purchase history.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user-product interaction data to recommend items based on similar user preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Leverages product metadata (e.g., descriptions) to recommend items similar to a specific product.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for robust recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
- **SciPy**: For performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

## Project Structure
```
.
├── recommendation_system.py  # Main script containing the implementation
├── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**:
   - User-product interaction data (e.g., ratings or purchase history).
   - Product metadata (e.g., title, category, description).

2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Constructs a user-item interaction matrix.
   - Applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict ratings for unseen products.

3. **Content-Based Filtering**:
   - Converts product descriptions into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
   - Computes cosine similarity between products.

4. **Hybrid Recommendations**:
   - Combines recommendations from collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/realtime-recommendation-system.git
   cd realtime-recommendation-system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python recommendation_system.py
   ```

## Usage
The script provides recommendations using three methods:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends products based on user interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends products similar to a given product.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines the above two methods.

### Example Output
```bash
Collaborative Filtering Recommendations for User 1: [102, 103]
Content-Based Recommendations for Product 101: [102, 103]
Hybrid Recommendations for User 1 and Product 101: [102, 103]
```

## Customization
- Update the `interactions` DataFrame with your user-product interaction data.
- Modify the `products` DataFrame with your product metadata (e.g., descriptions, categories).

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) or API for real-time recommendations.
- Integrate additional filtering methods like popularity-based or demographic-based filtering.
- Scale the system to handle large datasets using distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark).
